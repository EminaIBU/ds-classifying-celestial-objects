Classification of the Celestial Objects
==============================

What is this?
---------------

For this project, we preprocessed the SDSS DR18 dataset and showed the significance of distinct features such as magnitudes, radii, fluxes, and redshift.\
We used machine learning models: Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors.

After our comprehensive analysis, guided by evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score) - We showed how Classification Models can successfully classify Galaxies, Stars, and Quasars in the SDSS DR18 dataset.
